![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88f6444d-7e39-4042-b7f4-7dd0576ef30b)

This project aims to analyze a cybersecurity dataset to better understand the types of attacks, their frequency, targets, and the effectiveness of preventative measures. The analysis will help detect cyber-attack patterns, assess their damage, and evaluate how well different cybersecurity protocols have mitigated these threats.

## Objective

### 1. Distribution of Attack Types:

#### Objective:
Categorize and analyze the distribution of various attacks (e.g., DDoS, phishing, malware) to understand which are most preventable.

#### Approach: 
Group the attack types from the dataset and visualize the distribution to identify the most common types.

### 2. Attack Frequency (Time Series Analysis):
#### Objective: 
Perform a time series analysis on the occurrence of attacks to reveal trends, spikes, and periods with higher attack frequency.

#### Approach: 
Use the timestamp data to create a time series and observe the frequency and trends of attacks over time, identifying peak periods.

### 3. Target Analysis (Region and Organization):
#### Objective: 
Analyze the geo-location and user information to determine which regions, organizations, or industries are the most targeted.

#### Approach: 
Use geographic and organizational information to break down attacks by location and industry, helping to identify high-risk areas.

### 4. Damage Assessment:
#### Objective: 
Assess the financial or operational damage caused by attacks, if available in the dataset (via anomaly scores, financial indicators, or other damage metrics).

#### Approach: 
Compare the damage across different attack types and regions to quantify the impact of each type of cyber attack.

### 5. Preventive Measures (Effectiveness of Protocols):
#### Objective: 
Evaluate the effectiveness of different cybersecurity measures by examining responses such as blocking or logging attacks.

#### Approach: 
Analyze the action taken (e.g., blocked, logged) and protocol performance metrics to measure how well different security systems handled the attacks.

## Tools and Technologies :- 
Programming Languages: Python (for analysis and visualizations).

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Plotly (for visualization), Scikit-learn (if any machine learning is needed for anomaly detection).

Data Sources: Dataset containing cybersecurity events, including attack types, timestamps, geo-location data, and response actions.

Based on the objectives and data analysis we are performing for the CyberSecurity Threat Analysis Project, here are potential findings that could emerge from the analysis:

### 1. Distribution of Attack Types :-
- Findings: The analysis of attack types reveals that certain types of cyber-attacks are more prevalent. For example, DDoS attacks may be the most common, followed by Malware and Phishing.

- Interpretation: This suggests that specific cybersecurity protocols (such as DDoS mitigation measures) should be prioritized. It may also indicate that certain attack types are less preventable, necessitating better defense strategies or early detection mechanisms.

- Recommendations: Strengthen defense mechanisms against the most common attacks, such as DDoS and Malware

### 2. Attack Frequency :-
- Findings: Time series analysis shows periodic spikes in attack frequency, with attacks peaking during certain months (e.g., major events or holidays).
  
![cyber attack frequency overtime](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb1868c6-cef6-4f6d-998e-8c835f856e55)

- Interpretation: This highlights cyber threats during specific times of the year or after major organizational events.

- Recommendation: Focus on enhancing security during peak periods (e.g., implementing stronger defenses or monitoring during holidays or high-profile events).

### 3. Targeted Analysis (Region and Organization) :-
- Findings: Attacks are more frequent in certain regions or organizations. For example, certain geographical areas (e.g., North America or Europe) might be more targeted due to their higher digital presence or critical infrastructure.

![region affected by cyber attacks](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9dc42a3-3584-4363-b0af-c7cc9f747c8e)

- Interpretation: This suggests that some regions or sectors (e.g., finance or tech) are more at risk due to higher-value targets.

![ind_org affected by cybersecurity](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47832966-951d-49dc-a02c-c428de07c818)

- Recommendations: Tailor cybersecurity strategies for high-risk regions or industries. Increase monitoring and threat detection for vulnerable regions.

### 4. Damage Assessment :-
- Findings: Financial loss due to cyber-attacks is more significant for certain attack types. For instance, Malware attacks may result in higher financial damage compared to others like Phishing.
  
![distribution of attack type](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86f98fea-1935-425d-85f2-c83cae9848c4)

- Interpretation: The severity of financial damage correlates with the attack's impact, suggesting that stronger preventive measures should be implemented for high-damage attacks.

- Interpretation: Preventive measures work well, but real-time detection needs improvement, as logging alone can't stop ongoing attacks.

![log source distribution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3559128-dbee-4582-8b34-ba3b83aaab11)

- Recommendations: Enhance real-time detection systems, improve log analysis, and train staff on phishing and social engineering defenses.

### 6. User Information and Device Vulnerability :-
- Findings: Admin users and outdated systems are frequent cyber-attack targets.

- Interpretation: High-value targets and legacy systems are more vulnerable, requiring stronger security.

- Recommendations: Enforce strict access controls, MFA, and regularly update/patch systems.

## Key Outcomes :-
#### 1. Severity Levels Distribution :
- Majority of threats are of medium severity, followed by low and high severity.

#### 2. Attack Trends Over Time :
- Number of attacks fluctuates over time, with certain months showing spikes in activity.

#### 3. Traffic Type and Attack Type :
- Common traffic types include DNS and HTTP.
- Frequent attack types include DDoS, which spans multiple traffic types. 

#### 4. Source of High-Severity Attacks :
- A few Source IP Addresses are responsible for a large proportion of high-severity attacks.

#### 5. Packet and Anomaly Score Pattern :
- Packet Length shows a bimodal distribution, incdicating diverse traffic behaviors.
- Anomaly Scores are evenly distribution across the range, showing varied threat levels.

#### 6. Correlation Analysis :
- Weak correlations among numerical fratures (e.g., Packet Length, Anomaly Scores, Ports).

#### 7. Missing Data :
- Significant missing values in critical columns like IDS/IPS Alerts, Firewall Logs, and Proxy Information, indicating incomplete logging or data collection.

## Final Result :-

The project provides a comprehensive analysis of cybersecurity threats, highlighting the most frequent attack types, peak attack periods, vulnerable regions, and hight risk targets. It is also evaluates the financial and operationl impact of various attack types and assesses the effectiveness of preventive measures like firewalls, IDS/IPS systems, and logging mechanisums. The findings offer actionable recommendations to enhance cybersecurity strategies, such as focusing on high-value targets. This analysis equips stackeholders with data-driven insights to improve overall cyber defense systems.
